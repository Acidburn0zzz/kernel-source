Subject: KDB locking update for RT
Patch-Mainline: never

Convert kdb_lock to RAW_SPINLOCK. 

KDB is designed to operate non-preemptibly, and it deadlocks with 
itself when the kdb_lock operates as a mutex in the RT Kernel,

While there will be additional issues to resolve with KDB, this change 
is a step along the way to getting stack traces from KDB, that don't
pertain to internal KDB failures.
