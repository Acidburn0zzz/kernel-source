Subject: [PATCH] rt bit spinlocks: fix compile failure for !CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT

The RT patches disable the existing bit_spinlock.h defns with
an "#if 0" in favour of re-stating its own within spinlock.h
itself.  But the latter are incomplete when PREEMPT_RT is not set.

The smallest footprint change to work around this is to simply use
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT as a trigger to choose between the new spinlock.h
definitions, or the older/existing definitions.  This change should
be considered for folding into the rt-mutex-core.patch.
