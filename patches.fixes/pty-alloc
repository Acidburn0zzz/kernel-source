Subject: [PATCH] change pts allocation behaviour in

  Hello,

  Here is a patch to change the way ptses are allocated.  It applies against
2.6.6-rc3.  Basically it tries to humour old glibc by always obtaining a pts
in the range of 0-255 first.  However, if that fails, then it will search the
higher ranges.  The net effect should be that old glibc users won't notice
problems until they try and get more than 256 concurrent ptses (which would
break under the first-fit scheme anyway), yet we reduce the average number of 
iterations required to find a new pts when a lot are in use.  In the very
worst case of only one pts available, this still performs no worse than
the either the old or more recent allocation schemes.

  Thanks,
  Steve.
