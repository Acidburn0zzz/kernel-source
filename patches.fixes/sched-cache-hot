Subject: bug in sched.c:task_hot()
Date: Tue, 05 Oct 2004 04:50:05 +0200

Current implementation of task_hot() has a performance bug in it
that it will cause integer underflow.

Variable "now" (typically passed in as rq->timestamp_last_tick)
and p->timestamp are all defined as unsigned long long.  However,
If former is smaller than the latter, integer under flow occurs
which make the result of subtraction a huge positive number. Then
it is compared to sd->cache_hot_time and it will wrongly identify
a cache hot task as cache cold.

This bug causes large amount of incorrect process migration across
cpus (at stunning 10,000 per second) and we lost cache affinity very
quickly and almost took double digit performance regression on a db
transaction processing workload.  Patch to fix the bug.  Diff'ed against
2.6.9-rc3.
