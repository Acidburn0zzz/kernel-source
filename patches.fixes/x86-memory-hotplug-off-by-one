x86, memory hotplug: remove wrong -1 in calling init_memory_mapping()

Impact: fix crash with memory hotplug

Shuahua Li found:

| I just did some experiments on a desktop for memory hotplug and this bug
| triggered a crash in my test.
|
| Yinghai's suggestion also fixed the bug.

We don't need to round it, just remove that extra -1
