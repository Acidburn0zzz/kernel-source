Subject: move kernel_physical_mapping_init to __meminit
Patch-mainline: 2.6.29 (probably)
References: bnc#467474

kernel_physical_mapping_init() is called during memory hotplug
so it does not belong in the init section.

If the kernel is built with CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y on
the make command line, arch/x86/mm/init_64.c is compiled with
the -fno-inline-functions-called-once gcc option defeating
inlining of kernel_physical_mapping_init() within init_memory_mapping().
When kernel_physical_mapping_init() is not inlined it is placed
in the .init.text section according to the __init in it's current
declaration.  A later call to kernel_physical_mapping_init() during
a memory hotplug operation encounters an int3 trap because the
.init.text section memory has been freed.  This patch eliminates
the crash caused by the int3 trap by moving the non-inlined
kernel_physical_mapping_init() from .init.text to .meminit.text.
