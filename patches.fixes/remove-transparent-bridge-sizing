Subject: PCI: remove transparent bridge sizing
References: 331027
    
Remove transparent bridge sizing.

Due to code in pci_read_bridge_bases() [drivers/pci/probe.c] the child
bus of a transparent bridge already has access to the parent bus
resources so transparent bridge sizing appears unnecessary.  The bridge
sizing includes alignment and granularity adjustments that can cause
significantly more memory to be reserved from the parant bus than
required by devices on the child bus and allotted by _CRS.
