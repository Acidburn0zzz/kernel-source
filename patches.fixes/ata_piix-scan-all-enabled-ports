Subject: ata_piix does not find any devices on ACER laptop
From: Hannes Reinecke <hare@suse.de>
References: 78564

ICH6 spec defines the PORT_ bits as:
PORT_ENABLED (R/W): 
0 = Disabled. The port is in the  off  state and cannot detect any
devices.
1 = Enabled. The port can transition between the on,
partial, and slumber states and can detect devices.

PORT_PRESENT  (R/O) The status of this bit may change at any time. This
bit is cleared when the port is disabled via PORT_ENABLED. This bit is not
cleared upon surprise removal of a device.

So from a textual view it is not necessary that PORT_PRESENT _must_ be
set, especially if a device detection has to be done anyway. And, in
fact, this is the view that ACER has been taken with its new Laptops
(e.g. Travelmate 4150).

And the definition of PORT_ENABLED / PORT_PRESENT is mixed up, btw.
