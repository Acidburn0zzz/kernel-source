Ok,
 while we're discussing the other things, how about for now
just having this fairly minimal patch to get rid of the most egregious 
memory mis-use.

This removes the SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN and the cache line alignment on
"struct dentry", and to compensate for the fact that the inline name
length will shrink quite a bit it changes DNAME_INLINE_LEN_MIN from 16 to
24.

It also re-orders the first few fields of the dentry, since the "count"  
and "d_lock" should be 32-bit on most 64-bit architectures, so to avoid
having unnecessary unused space, we should just put them together
(everything else there is goign to be comprised of 64-bit entities, I
think).

So this should bring the size of a dentry down to 160 bytes on x86, from
either 192 of 256 bytes (depending on cacheline size). And 24 bytes of
inline name (it can be a bit more on some architectures, due to longword
alignment or similar) should still capture most of the dentries by far.

Let's see what Andrew's more complex patches can do to bring the size of 
"struct dentry" down further.
