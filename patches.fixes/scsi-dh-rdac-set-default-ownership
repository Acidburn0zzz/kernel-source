Subject: scsi_dh_rdac: make sure the ownership is set correctly
From: Chandra Seetharaman <sekharan@us.ibm.com>
Patch-Mainline: 2.6.28
References: bnc#441337

When the controller ownership is changed (from passive to active),
check_ownership() doesn't set the state of the device to ACTIVE.

This patch fixes the problem.
