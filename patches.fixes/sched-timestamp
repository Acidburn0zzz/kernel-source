Subject: bug in sched.c:activate_task()
Date: Tue, 05 Oct 2004 04:20:09 +0200

Update p->timestamp to "now" in activate_task() doesn't look right
to me at all.  p->timestamp records last time it was running on a
cpu.  activate_task shouldn't update that variable when it queues
a task on the runqueue.

This bug (and combined with others) triggers improper load balancing.

Patch against linux-2.6.9-rc3.  Didn't diff it against 2.6.9-rc3-mm2
because mm tree has so many change in sched.c.
