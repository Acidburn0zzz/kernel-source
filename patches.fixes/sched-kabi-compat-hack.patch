Subject: sched: leave RT_GROUP_SCHED structure components intact to preserve kABI

From: Gregory Haskins <ghaskins@novell.com>

We have already commited to a kABI which includes components from
RT_GROUP_SCHED.  However, that feature has been found to be broken
so we shouldnt ship with it on.  The best short term solution may be
to hack structure components back in (while leaving the actual code
disabled) to preserve compatibility.
