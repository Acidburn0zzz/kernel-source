Subject: Re: [PATCH][5/?] count writeback pages in nr_scanned
Patch-mainline: no

OOM kills have been observed with 70% of the pages in lowmem being in the
writeback state.  If we count those pages in sc->nr_scanned, the VM should
throttle and wait for IO completion, instead of OOM killing.

(akpm: this is how the code was designed to work - we broke it six months
ago).
