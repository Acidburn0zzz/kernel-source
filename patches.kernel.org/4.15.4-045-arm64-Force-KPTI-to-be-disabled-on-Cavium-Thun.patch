Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Force KPTI to be disabled on Cavium ThunderX
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.4
Git-commit: ccb60ecfe8782db3f72289ac78ee23579372fa42

Commit 6dc52b15c4a4 upstream.

Cavium ThunderX's erratum 27456 results in a corruption of icache
entries that are loaded from memory that is mapped as non-global
(i.e. ASID-tagged).

As KPTI is based on memory being mapped non-global, let's prevent
it from kicking in if this erratum is detected.
