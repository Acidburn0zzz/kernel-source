Subject: [PATCH] libceph: reschedule a tick in finish_hunting()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.7
Git-commit: 7b4c443d139f1d2b5570da475f7a9cbcef86740c

commit 7b4c443d139f1d2b5570da475f7a9cbcef86740c upstream.

If we go without an established session for a while, backoff delay will
climb to 30 seconds.  The keepalive timeout is also 30 seconds, so it's
pretty easily hit after a prolonged hunting for a monitor: we don't get
a chance to send out a keepalive in time, which means we never get back
a keepalive ack in time, cutting an established session and attempting
to connect to a different monitor every 30 seconds:

  [Sun Apr 1 23:37:05 2018] libceph: mon0 10.80.20.99:6789 session established
  [Sun Apr 1 23:37:36 2018] libceph: mon0 10.80.20.99:6789 session lost, hunting for new mon
  [Sun Apr 1 23:37:36 2018] libceph: mon2 10.80.20.103:6789 session established
  [Sun Apr 1 23:38:07 2018] libceph: mon2 10.80.20.103:6789 session lost, hunting for new mon
  [Sun Apr 1 23:38:07 2018] libceph: mon1 10.80.20.100:6789 session established
  [Sun Apr 1 23:38:37 2018] libceph: mon1 10.80.20.100:6789 session lost, hunting for new mon
  [Sun Apr 1 23:38:37 2018] libceph: mon2 10.80.20.103:6789 session established
  [Sun Apr 1 23:39:08 2018] libceph: mon2 10.80.20.103:6789 session lost, hunting for new mon

The regular keepalive interval is 10 seconds.  After ->hunting is
cleared in finish_hunting(), call __schedule_delayed() to ensure we
send out a keepalive after 10 seconds.
