Subject: [PATCH] PM / devfreq: Check NULL governor in available_governors_show
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.9
Git-commit: d68adc8f85cd757bd33c8d7b2660ad6f16f7f3dc

commit d68adc8f85cd757bd33c8d7b2660ad6f16f7f3dc upstream.

The governor is initialized after sysfs attributes become visible so in
theory the governor field can be NULL here.

Fixes: bcf23c79c4e46 ("PM / devfreq: Fix available_governor sysfs")
