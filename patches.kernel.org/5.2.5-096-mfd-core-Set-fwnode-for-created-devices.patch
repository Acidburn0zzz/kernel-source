Subject: [PATCH] mfd: core: Set fwnode for created devices
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: c176c6d7e932662668bcaec2d763657096589d85

[ Upstream commit c176c6d7e932662668bcaec2d763657096589d85 ]

The logic for setting the of_node on devices created by mfd did not set
the fwnode pointer to match, which caused fwnode-based APIs to
malfunction on these devices since the fwnode pointer was null. Fix
this.
