Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6: rdu2: Limit USBH1 to Full Speed
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: 6bb1e09c4c375db29770444f689f35f5cbe696bc

[ Upstream commit 6bb1e09c4c375db29770444f689f35f5cbe696bc ]

Cabling used to connect devices to USBH1 on RDU2 does not meet USB
spec cable quality and cable length requirements to operate at High
Speed, so limit the port to Full Speed only.
