Subject: [PATCH] SMB3: Fix deadlock in validate negotiate hits reconnect
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.9
Git-commit: e99c63e4d86d3a94818693147b469fa70de6f945

commit e99c63e4d86d3a94818693147b469fa70de6f945 upstream.

Currently we skip SMB2_TREE_CONNECT command when checking during
reconnect because Tree Connect happens when establishing
an SMB session. For SMB 3.0 protocol version the code also calls
validate negotiate which results in SMB2_IOCL command being sent
over the wire. This may deadlock on trying to acquire a mutex when
checking for reconnect. Fix this by skipping SMB2_IOCL command
when doing the reconnect check.
