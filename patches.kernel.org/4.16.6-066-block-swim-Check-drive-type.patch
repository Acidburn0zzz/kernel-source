Subject: [PATCH] block/swim: Check drive type
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.6
Git-commit: 8a500df63d07d8aee44b7ee2c54e462e47ce93ec

commit 8a500df63d07d8aee44b7ee2c54e462e47ce93ec upstream.

The SWIM chip is compatible with GCR-mode Sony 400K/800K drives but
this driver only supports MFM mode. Therefore only Sony FDHD drives
are supported. Skip incompatible drives.
