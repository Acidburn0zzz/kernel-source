Subject: [PATCH] staging: most: core: use device description as name
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.10
Git-commit: 131ac62253dba79daf4a6d83ab12293d2b9863d3

commit 131ac62253dba79daf4a6d83ab12293d2b9863d3 upstream.

This patch uses the device description to clearly identity a device
attached to the bus. It is needed as the currently useed mdevX
notation is not sufficiant in case more than one network
interface controller is being used at the same time.
