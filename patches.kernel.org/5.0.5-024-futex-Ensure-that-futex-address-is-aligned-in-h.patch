Subject: [PATCH] futex: Ensure that futex address is aligned in
 handle_futex_death()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.0.5
Git-commit: 5a07168d8d89b00fe1760120714378175b3ef992

commit 5a07168d8d89b00fe1760120714378175b3ef992 upstream.

The futex code requires that the user space addresses of futexes are 32bit
aligned. sys_futex() checks this in futex_get_keys() but the robust list
code has no alignment check in place.

As a consequence the kernel crashes on architectures with strict alignment
requirements in handle_futex_death() when trying to cmpxchg() on an
unaligned futex address which was retrieved from the robust list.

[ tglx: Rewrote changelog, proper sizeof() based alignement check and add
  	comment ]
