Subject: [PATCH] mm/sparse.c: fix typo in online_mem_sections
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.13.2
Git-commit: b4ccec41af82b5a5518c6534444412961894f07c

commit b4ccec41af82b5a5518c6534444412961894f07c upstream.

online_mem_sections() accidentally marks online only the first section
in the given range.  This is a typo which hasn't been noticed because I
haven't tested large 2GB blocks previously.  All users of
pfn_to_online_page would get confused on the the rest of the pfn range
in the block.

All we need to fix this is to use iterator (pfn) rather than start_pfn.
