Subject: [PATCH] firmware: imx: scu-pd: Align imx sc msg structs to 4
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.9
Git-commit: 7c1a1c814ccc858633c761951c2546041202b24e

commit 7c1a1c814ccc858633c761951c2546041202b24e upstream.

The imx SC api strongly assumes that messages are composed out of
4-bytes words but some of our message structs have odd sizeofs.

This produces many oopses with CONFIG_KASAN=y.

Fix by marking with __aligned(4).
