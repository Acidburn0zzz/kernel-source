Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: logicpd-somlv: Fix interrupt on mmc3_dat1
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.10
Git-commit: 3d8b804bc528d3720ec0c39c212af92dafaf6e84

[ Upstream commit 3d8b804bc528d3720ec0c39c212af92dafaf6e84 ]

The interrupt on mmc3_dat1 is wrong which prevents this from
appearing in /proc/interrupts.

Fixes: ab8dd3aed011 ("ARM: DTS: Add minimal Support for Logic PD
DM3730 SOM-LV") #Kernel 4.9+
