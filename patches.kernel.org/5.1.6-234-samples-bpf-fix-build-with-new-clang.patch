Subject: [PATCH] samples/bpf: fix build with new clang
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6

[ Upstream commit 636e78b1cdb40b77a79b143dbd9d94847b360efa ]

clang started to error on invalid asm clobber usage in x86 headers
and many bpf program samples failed to build with the message:

Override volatile() to workaround the problem.
