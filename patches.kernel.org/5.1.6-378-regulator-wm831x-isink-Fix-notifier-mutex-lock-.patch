Subject: [PATCH] regulator: wm831x isink: Fix notifier mutex lock warning
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.6
Git-commit: f7a621728a6a23bfd2c6ac4d3e42e1303aefde0f

[ Upstream commit f7a621728a6a23bfd2c6ac4d3e42e1303aefde0f ]

The mutex for the regulator_dev must be controlled by the caller of
the regulator_notifier_call_chain(), as described in the comment
for that function.

Failure to mutex lock and unlock surrounding the notifier call results
in a kernel WARN_ON_ONCE() which will dump a backtrace for the
regulator_notifier_call_chain() when that function call is first made.
The mutex can be controlled using the regulator_lock/unlock() API.
