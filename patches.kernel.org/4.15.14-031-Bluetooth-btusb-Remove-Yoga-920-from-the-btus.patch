Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: btusb: Remove Yoga 920 from the
 btusb_needs_reset_resume_table
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.14
Git-commit: f0e8c61110c2c85903b136ba070daf643a8b6842

commit f0e8c61110c2c85903b136ba070daf643a8b6842 upstream.

Commit 1fdb92697469 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Use DMI matching for QCA
reset_resume quirking"), added the Lenovo Yoga 920 to the
btusb_needs_reset_resume_table.

Testing has shown that this is a false positive and the problems where
caused by issues with the initial fix: commit fd865802c66b ("Bluetooth:
btusb: fix QCA Rome suspend/resume"), which has already been reverted.

So the QCA Rome BT in the Yoga 920 does not need a reset-resume quirk at
all and this commit removes it from the btusb_needs_reset_resume_table.

Note that after this commit the btusb_needs_reset_resume_table is now
empty. It is kept around on purpose, since this whole series of commits
started for a reason and there are actually broken platforms around,
which need to be added to it.
