Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: bcm2837: Fix polarity of wifi reset GPIOs
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.11
Git-commit: e25b6783c7b1bb79103d4617336879423f86b05e

commit e25b6783c7b1bb79103d4617336879423f86b05e upstream.

The commit b1b8f45b3130 ("ARM: dts: bcm2837: Add missing GPIOs of Expander")
introduced a wifi power sequence. Unfortunately the polarity of the reset
GPIOs were wrong and broke the wifi support on Raspberry Pi 3 B and
later in 3 B+. This wasn't discovered before since the power sequence
takes only effect in case the relevant MMC driver is compiled as a module.
