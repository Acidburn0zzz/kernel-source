Subject: [PATCH] libbpf: fix false uninitialized variable warning
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.6
Git-commit: aef70a1f44c0b570e6345c02c2d240471859f0a4

[ Upstream commit aef70a1f44c0b570e6345c02c2d240471859f0a4 ]

Some compilers emit warning for potential uninitialized next_id usage.
The code is correct, but control flow is too complicated for some
compilers to figure this out. Re-initialize next_id to satisfy
compiler.
