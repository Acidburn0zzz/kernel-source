Subject: [PATCH] net: bridge: delete local fdb on device init failure
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.8
Git-commit: d7bae09fa008c6c9a489580db0a5a12063b97f97

[ Upstream commit d7bae09fa008c6c9a489580db0a5a12063b97f97 ]

On initialization failure we have to delete the local fdb which was
inserted due to the default pvid creation. This problem has been present
since the inception of default_pvid. Note that currently there are 2 cases:
1) in br_dev_init() when br_multicast_init() fails
2) if register_netdevice() fails after calling ndo_init()

This patch takes care of both since br_vlan_flush() is called on both
occasions. Also the new fdb delete would be a no-op on normal bridge
device destruction since the local fdb would've been already flushed by
br_dev_delete(). This is not an issue for ports since nbp_vlan_init() is
called last when adding a port thus nothing can fail after it.
