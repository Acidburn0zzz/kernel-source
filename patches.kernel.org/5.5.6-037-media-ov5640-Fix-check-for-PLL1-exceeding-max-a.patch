Subject: [PATCH] media: ov5640: Fix check for PLL1 exceeding max allowed rate
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: 2e3df204f9af42a47823ee955c08950373417420

[ Upstream commit 2e3df204f9af42a47823ee955c08950373417420 ]

The variable _rate is by ov5640_compute_sys_clk() which returns
zero if the PLL exceeds 1GHz.  Unfortunately, the check to see
if the max PLL1 output is checking 'rate' and not '_rate' and
'rate' does not ever appear to be 0.

This patch changes the check against the returned value of
'_rate' to determine if the PLL1 output exceeds 1GHz.
