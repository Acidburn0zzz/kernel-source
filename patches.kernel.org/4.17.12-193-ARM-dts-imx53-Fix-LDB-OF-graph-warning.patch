Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx53: Fix LDB OF graph warning
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 77dd4bd0c0db8e4856e7abc2192f126e226e14c5

[ Upstream commit 77dd4bd0c0db8e4856e7abc2192f126e226e14c5 ]

Single child nodes in OF graph don't need an address and now dtc will
warn about this:

Warning (graph_child_address): /soc/aips@50000000/ldb@53fa8008/lvds-channel@0: graph node has single child node 'port@0', #address-cells/#size-cells are not necessary

Since the LDB should always have an output port, fix the warning by
adding the output port, 2, to the DT.
