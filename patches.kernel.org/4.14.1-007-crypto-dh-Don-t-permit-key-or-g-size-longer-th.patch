Subject: [PATCH] crypto: dh - Don't permit 'key' or 'g' size longer than 'p'
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.1
Git-commit: ccd9888f14a8019c0bbdeeae758aba1f58693712

commit ccd9888f14a8019c0bbdeeae758aba1f58693712 upstream.

The "qat-dh" DH implementation assumes that 'key' and 'g' can be copied
into a buffer with size 'p_size'.  However it was never checked that
that was actually the case, which most likely allowed users to cause a
buffer underflow via KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE.

Fix this by updating crypto_dh_decode_key() to verify this precondition
for all DH implementations.
