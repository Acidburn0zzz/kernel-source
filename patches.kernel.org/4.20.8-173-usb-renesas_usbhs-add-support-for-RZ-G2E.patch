Subject: [PATCH] usb: renesas_usbhs: add support for RZ/G2E
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 1d6e81a288e28d8d0e38e0501a324216f79bba35

[ Upstream commit 1d6e81a288e28d8d0e38e0501a324216f79bba35 ]

HS-USB found in RZ/G2E (a.k.a. r8a774c0) is very similar to the
one found in R-Car E3 (a.k.a. r8a77990), as it needs to release
the PLL reset by the UGCTRL register like R-Car E3, therefore add
r8a774c0 support in a similar fashion to what was done for the
r8a77990.
