Subject: [PATCH] perf/core: Fix mlock accounting in perf_mmap()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.3
Git-commit: 003461559ef7a9bd0239bae35a22ad8924d6e9ad

commit 003461559ef7a9bd0239bae35a22ad8924d6e9ad upstream.

Decreasing sysctl_perf_event_mlock between two consecutive perf_mmap()s of
a perf ring buffer may lead to an integer underflow in locked memory
accounting. This may lead to the undesired behaviors, such as failures in
BPF map creation.

Address this by adjusting the accounting logic to take into account the
possibility that the amount of already locked memory may exceed the
current limit.

Fixes: c4b75479741c ("perf/core: Make the mlock accounting simple again")
