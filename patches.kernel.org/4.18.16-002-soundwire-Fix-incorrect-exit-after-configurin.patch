Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: Fix incorrect exit after configuring stream
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.16
Git-commit: 3fef1a2259c556cce34df2791688cb3001f81c92

[ Upstream commit 3fef1a2259c556cce34df2791688cb3001f81c92 ]

In sdw_stream_add_master() after the Master ports are configured,
the stream is released incorrectly.

So, fix it by avoiding stream release after configuring the Master
for the stream.
While at it, rename the label appropriately.
