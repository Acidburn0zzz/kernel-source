Subject: [PATCH] IMA: Check IMA policy flag
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: c5563bad88e07017e08cce1142903e501598c80c

[ Upstream commit c5563bad88e07017e08cce1142903e501598c80c ]

process_buffer_measurement() may be called prior to IMA being
initialized (for instance, when the IMA hook is called when
a key is added to the .builtin_trusted_keys keyring), which
would result in a kernel panic.

This patch adds the check in process_buffer_measurement()
to return immediately if IMA is not initialized yet.
