Subject: [PATCH] ext4: enforce the immutable flag on open files
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.4
Git-commit: 02b016ca7f99229ae6227e7b2fc950c4e140d74a

commit 02b016ca7f99229ae6227e7b2fc950c4e140d74a upstream.

According to the chattr man page, "a file with the 'i' attribute
cannot be modified..."  Historically, this was only enforced when the
file was opened, per the rest of the description, "... and the file
can not be opened in write mode".

There is general agreement that we should standardize all file systems
to prevent modifications even for files that were opened at the time
the immutable flag is set.  Eventually, a change to enforce this at
the VFS layer should be landing in mainline.  Until then, enforce this
at the ext4 level to prevent xfstests generic/553 from failing.
