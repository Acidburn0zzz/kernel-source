Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: device stats, log when stats are zeroed
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: a69976bc69308aa475d0ba3b8b3efd1d013c0460

[ Upstream commit a69976bc69308aa475d0ba3b8b3efd1d013c0460 ]

We had a report indicating that some read errors aren't reported by the
device stats in the userland. It is important to have the errors
reported in the device stat as user land scripts might depend on it to
take the reasonable corrective actions. But to debug these issue we need
to be really sure that request to reset the device stat did not come
from the userland itself. So log an info message when device error reset
happens.

For example:
 BTRFS info (device sdc): device stats zeroed by btrfs(9223)
