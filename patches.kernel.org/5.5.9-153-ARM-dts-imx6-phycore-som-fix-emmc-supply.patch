Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6: phycore-som: fix emmc supply
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.9
Git-commit: eb0bbba7636b9fc81939d6087a5fe575e150c95a

commit eb0bbba7636b9fc81939d6087a5fe575e150c95a upstream.

Currently the vmmc is supplied by the 1.8V pmic rail but this is wrong.
The default module behaviour is to power VCCQ and VCC by the 3.3V power
rail. Optional the user can connect the VCCQ to the pmic 1.8V emmc
power rail using a solder jumper.
