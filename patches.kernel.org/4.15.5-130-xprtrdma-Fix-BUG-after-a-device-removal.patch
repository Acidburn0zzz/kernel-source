Subject: [PATCH] xprtrdma: Fix BUG after a device removal
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.5
Git-commit: e89e8d8fcdc6751e86ccad794b052fe67e6ad619

commit e89e8d8fcdc6751e86ccad794b052fe67e6ad619 upstream.

Michal Kalderon reports a BUG that occurs just after device removal:

[  169.112490] rpcrdma: removing device qedr0 for 192.168.110.146:20049
[  169.143909] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
[  169.181837] IP: rpcrdma_dma_unmap_regbuf+0xa/0x60 [rpcrdma]

The RPC/RDMA client transport attempts to allocate some resources
on demand. Registered buffers are one such resource. These are
allocated (or re-allocated) by xprt_rdma_allocate to hold RPC Call
and Reply messages. A hardware resource is associated with each of
these buffers, as they can be used for a Send or Receive Work
Request.

If a device is removed from under an NFS/RDMA mount, the transport
layer is responsible for releasing all hardware resources before
the device can be finally unplugged. A BUG results when the NFS
mount hasn't yet seen much activity: the transport tries to release
resources that haven't yet been allocated.

rpcrdma_free_regbuf() already checks for this case, so just move
that check to cover the DEVICE_REMOVAL case as well.
