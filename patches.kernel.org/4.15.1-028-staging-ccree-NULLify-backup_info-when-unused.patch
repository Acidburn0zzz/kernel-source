Subject: [PATCH] staging: ccree: NULLify backup_info when unused
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.1
Git-commit: 46df8824982e4fb0198776078d4a8c3e2d531464

commit 46df8824982e4fb0198776078d4a8c3e2d531464 upstream.

backup_info field is only allocated for decrypt code path.
The field was not nullified when not used causing a kfree
in an error handling path to attempt to free random
addresses as uncovered in stress testing.
