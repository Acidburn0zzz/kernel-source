Subject: [PATCH] power: supply: sbs-battery: use correct flags field
References: bnc#1151927
Patch-mainline: 5.3.6
Git-commit: 99956a9e08251a1234434b492875b1eaff502a12

commit 99956a9e08251a1234434b492875b1eaff502a12 upstream.

the type flag is stored in the chip->flags field not in the
client->flags field. This currently leads to never using the ti
specific health function as client->flags doesn't use that bit.
So it's always falling back to the general one.
