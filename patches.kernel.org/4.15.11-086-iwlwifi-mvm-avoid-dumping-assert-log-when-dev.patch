Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: avoid dumping assert log when device is stopped
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.15.11
Git-commit: 6362ab721ef5c4ecfa01f53ad4137d3d984f0c6c

[ Upstream commit 6362ab721ef5c4ecfa01f53ad4137d3d984f0c6c ]

We might erroneously get to error dumping code when the
device is already stopped.

In that case the driver will detect a defective value and will try to
reset the HW, assuming it is only a bus issue.  The driver than
proceeds with the dumping.

The result has two side effects:

1. The device won't be stopped again, since the transport status is
already stopped, so the device remains powered on while it actually
should be stopped.

2. The dump in that case is completely garbaged and useless.

Detect and avoid this.  It will also make debugging such issues
easier.
