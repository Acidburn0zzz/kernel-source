Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Respect O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags during reconnect
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.6
Git-commit: 44805b0e62f15e90d233485420e1847133716bdc

commit 44805b0e62f15e90d233485420e1847133716bdc upstream.

Currently the client translates O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags
into corresponding SMB create options when openning a file.
The problem is that on reconnect when the file is being
re-opened the client doesn't set those flags and it causes
a server to reject re-open requests because create options
don't match. The latter means that any subsequent system
call against that open file fail until a share is re-mounted.

Fix this by properly setting SMB create options when
re-openning files after reconnects.

Fixes: 1013e760d10e6: ("SMB3: Don't ignore O_SYNC/O_DSYNC and O_DIRECT flags")
