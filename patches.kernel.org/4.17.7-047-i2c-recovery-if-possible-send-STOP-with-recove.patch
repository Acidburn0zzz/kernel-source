Subject: [PATCH] i2c: recovery: if possible send STOP with recovery pulses
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.7
Git-commit: abe41184abac487264a4904bfcff2d5500dccce6

commit abe41184abac487264a4904bfcff2d5500dccce6 upstream.

I2C clients may misunderstand recovery pulses if they can't read SDA to
bail out early. In the worst case, as a write operation. To avoid that
and if we can write SDA, try to send STOP to avoid the
misinterpretation.
