Subject: [PATCH] net: cavium: fix driver name
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.14
Git-commit: 3434341004a380f4e47c3a03d4320d43982162a0

[ Upstream commit 3434341004a380f4e47c3a03d4320d43982162a0 ]

The driver name gets exposed in sysfs under /sys/bus/pci/drivers
so it should look like other devices. Change it to be common
format (instead of "Cavium PTP").

This is a trivial fix that was observed by accident because
Debian kernels were building this driver into kernel (bug).
