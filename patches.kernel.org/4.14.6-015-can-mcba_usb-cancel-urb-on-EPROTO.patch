Subject: [PATCH] can: mcba_usb: cancel urb on -EPROTO
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.6
Git-commit: c7f33023308f3142433b7379718af5f0c2c322a6

commit c7f33023308f3142433b7379718af5f0c2c322a6 upstream.

When we unplug the device, we can see both -EPIPE and -EPROTO depending
on exact timing and what system we run on. If we continue to resubmit
URBs, they will immediately fail, and they can cause stalls, especially
on slower CPUs.

Fix this by not resubmitting on -EPROTO, as we already do on -EPIPE.
