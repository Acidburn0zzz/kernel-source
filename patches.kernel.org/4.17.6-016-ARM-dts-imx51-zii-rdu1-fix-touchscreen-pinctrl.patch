Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx51-zii-rdu1: fix touchscreen pinctrl
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.6
Git-commit: 06d793b114e9d922c03aa077ac6c5c51fdda2722

commit 06d793b114e9d922c03aa077ac6c5c51fdda2722 upstream.

The pinctrl settings were incorrect for the touchscreen interrupt line, causing
an interrupt storm. This change has been tested with both the atmel_mxt_ts and
RMI4 drivers on the RDU1 units.

The value 0x4 comes from the value of register IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL_PAD_CSI1_D8
from the old vendor kernel.
