Subject: [PATCH] ipv4: mpls: fix mpls_xmit for iptunnel
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.12
Git-commit: 803f3e22ae10003a83c781498c0ac34cfe3463ff

[ Upstream commit 803f3e22ae10003a83c781498c0ac34cfe3463ff ]

When using mpls over gre/gre6 setup, rt->rt_gw4 address is not set, the
same for rt->rt_gw_family.  Therefore, when rt->rt_gw_family is checked
in mpls_xmit(), neigh_xmit() call is skipped. As a result, such setup
doesn't work anymore.

This issue was found with LTP mpls03 tests.

Fixes: 1550c171935d ("ipv4: Prepare rtable for IPv6 gateway")
