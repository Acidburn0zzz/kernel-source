Subject: [PATCH] remoteproc: q6v5-mss: Remove mem clk from the active pool
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.6
Git-commit: 6ba519aa13758dd55248f3a6f939536656df2661

[ Upstream commit 6ba519aa13758dd55248f3a6f939536656df2661 ]

Currently the mem clk is voted upon from both the active and proxy pool on
MSM8998 SoCs where only a proxy vote should suffice. Fix this by removing
mem clk from the active pool.
