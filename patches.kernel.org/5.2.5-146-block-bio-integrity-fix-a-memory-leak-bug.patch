Subject: [PATCH] block/bio-integrity: fix a memory leak bug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.5
Git-commit: e7bf90e5afe3aa1d1282c1635a49e17a32c4ecec

[ Upstream commit e7bf90e5afe3aa1d1282c1635a49e17a32c4ecec ]

In bio_integrity_prep(), a kernel buffer is allocated through kmalloc() to
hold integrity metadata. Later on, the buffer will be attached to the bio
structure through bio_integrity_add_page(), which returns the number of
bytes of integrity metadata attached. Due to unexpected situations,
bio_integrity_add_page() may return 0. As a result, bio_integrity_prep()
needs to be terminated with 'false' returned to indicate this error.
However, the allocated kernel buffer is not freed on this execution path,
leading to a memory leak.

To fix this issue, free the allocated buffer before returning from
bio_integrity_prep().
