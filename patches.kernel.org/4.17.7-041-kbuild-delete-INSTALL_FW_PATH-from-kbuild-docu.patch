Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: delete INSTALL_FW_PATH from kbuild documentation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.7
Git-commit: 3f9cdee5929b7d035e86302dcf08fbf3e80b0739

commit 3f9cdee5929b7d035e86302dcf08fbf3e80b0739 upstream.

Removed Kbuild documentation for INSTALL_FW_PATH.

The kbuild symbol INSTALL_FW_PATH was removed from Kbuild tools in
September 2017 (for 4.14) but the symbol was not deleted from
the kbuild documentation, so do that now.
