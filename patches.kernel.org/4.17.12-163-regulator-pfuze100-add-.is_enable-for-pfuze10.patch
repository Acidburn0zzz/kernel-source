Subject: [PATCH] regulator: pfuze100: add .is_enable() for
 pfuze100_swb_regulator_ops
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.17.12
Git-commit: 0b01fd3d40fe6402e5fa3b491ef23109feb1aaa5

[ Upstream commit 0b01fd3d40fe6402e5fa3b491ef23109feb1aaa5 ]

If is_enabled() is not defined, regulator core will assume
this regulator is already enabled, then it can NOT be really
enabled after disabled.

Based on Li Jun's patch from the NXP kernel tree.
