Subject: [PATCH] exec: avoid RLIMIT_STACK races with prlimit()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.14.4
Git-commit: 04e35f4495dd560db30c25efca4eecae8ec8c375

commit 04e35f4495dd560db30c25efca4eecae8ec8c375 upstream.

While the defense-in-depth RLIMIT_STACK limit on setuid processes was
protected against races from other threads calling setrlimit(), I missed
protecting it against races from external processes calling prlimit().
This adds locking around the change and makes sure that rlim_max is set
too.
