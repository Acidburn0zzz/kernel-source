Subject: [PATCH] ceph: fix compat_ioctl for ceph_dir_operations
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.4
Git-commit: 18bd6caaef4021803dd0d031dc37c2d001d18a5b

commit 18bd6caaef4021803dd0d031dc37c2d001d18a5b upstream.

The ceph_ioctl function is used both for files and directories, but only
the files support doing that in 32-bit compat mode.

On the s390 architecture, there is also a problem with invalid 31-bit
pointers that need to be passed through compat_ptr().

Use the new compat_ptr_ioctl() to address both issues.

Note: When backporting this patch to stable kernels, "compat_ioctl:
add compat_ptr_ioctl()" is needed as well.
