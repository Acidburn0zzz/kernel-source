Subject: [PATCH] net/tls: fix no wakeup on partial reads
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.1.7
Git-commit: 04b25a5411f966c2e586909a8496553b71876fae

[ Upstream commit 04b25a5411f966c2e586909a8496553b71876fae ]

When tls_sw_recvmsg() partially copies a record it pops that
record from ctx->recv_pkt and places it on rx_list.

Next iteration of tls_sw_recvmsg() reads from rx_list via
process_rx_list() before it enters the decryption loop.
If there is no more records to be read tls_wait_data()
will put the process on the wait queue and got to sleep.
This is incorrect, because some data was already copied
in process_rx_list().

In case of RPC connections process may never get woken up,
because peer also simply blocks in read().

I think this may also fix a similar issue when BPF is at
play, because after __tcp_bpf_recvmsg() returns some data
we subtract it from len and use continue to restart the
loop, but len could have just reached 0, so again we'd
sleep unnecessarily. That's added by:
commit d3b18ad31f93 ("tls: add bpf support to sk_msg handling")
