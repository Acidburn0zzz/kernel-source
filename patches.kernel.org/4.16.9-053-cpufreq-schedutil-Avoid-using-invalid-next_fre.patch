Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: schedutil: Avoid using invalid next_freq
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.16.9
Git-commit: 97739501f207efe33145b918817f305b822987f8

commit 97739501f207efe33145b918817f305b822987f8 upstream.

If the next_freq field of struct sugov_policy is set to UINT_MAX,
it shouldn't be used for updating the CPU frequency (this is a
special "invalid" value), but after commit b7eaf1aab9f8 (cpufreq:
schedutil: Avoid reducing frequency of busy CPUs prematurely) it
may be passed as the new frequency to sugov_update_commit() in
sugov_update_single().

Fix that by adding an extra check for the special UINT_MAX value
of next_freq to sugov_update_single().

Fixes: b7eaf1aab9f8 (cpufreq: schedutil: Avoid reducing frequency of busy CPUs prematurely)
