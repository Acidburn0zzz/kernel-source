Subject: [PATCH] blk-iolatency: only account submitted bios
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.3
Git-commit: a3fb01ba5af066521f3f3421839e501bb2c71805

[ Upstream commit a3fb01ba5af066521f3f3421839e501bb2c71805 ]

As is, iolatency recognizes done_bio and cleanup as ending paths. If a
request is marked REQ_NOWAIT and fails to get a request, the bio is
cleaned up via rq_qos_cleanup() and ended in bio_wouldblock_error().
This results in underflowing the inflight counter. Fix this by only
accounting bios that were actually submitted.
