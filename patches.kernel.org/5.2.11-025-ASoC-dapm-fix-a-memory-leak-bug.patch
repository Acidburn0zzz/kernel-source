Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: fix a memory leak bug
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.2.11
Git-commit: 45004d66f2a28d78f543fb2ffbc133e31dc2d162

[ Upstream commit 45004d66f2a28d78f543fb2ffbc133e31dc2d162 ]

In snd_soc_dapm_new_control_unlocked(), a kernel buffer is allocated in
dapm_cnew_widget() to hold the new dapm widget. Then, different actions are
taken according to the id of the widget, i.e., 'w->id'. If any failure
occurs during this process, snd_soc_dapm_new_control_unlocked() should be
terminated by going to the 'request_failed' label. However, the allocated
kernel buffer is not freed on this code path, leading to a memory leak bug.

To fix the above issue, free the buffer before returning from
snd_soc_dapm_new_control_unlocked() through the 'request_failed' label.
