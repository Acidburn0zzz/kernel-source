Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: MPC52xx needs u-boot but we don't have it.

 This patch disables automatic building of cuImage.52xx since it
 requires u-boot's mkimage to link. We currently don't have a u-boot
 packages, and attempts to get a recent version of u-boot have failed
 due to www.denx.de's git server killing connections.

 Once we have a u-boot package built, we can kill this patch.
