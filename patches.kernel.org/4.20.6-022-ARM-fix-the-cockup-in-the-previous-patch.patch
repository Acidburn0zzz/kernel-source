Subject: [PATCH] ARM: fix the cockup in the previous patch
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.6
Git-commit: d1c7a6fea7a81dec9fcc5346bf3b879feedebba9

Commit d6951f582cc50ba0ad22ef46b599740966599b14 upstream.

The intention in the previous patch was to only place the processor
tables in the .rodata section if big.Little was being built and we
wanted the branch target hardening, but instead (due to the way it
was tested) it ended up always placing the tables into the .rodata
section.

Although harmless, let's correct this anyway.
