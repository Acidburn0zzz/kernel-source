Subject: [PATCH] acpi, nfit: Fix ARS overflow continuation
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.19.3
Git-commit: 3fa58dcab50a0aa16817f16a8d38aee869eb3fb9

commit 3fa58dcab50a0aa16817f16a8d38aee869eb3fb9 upstream.

When the platform BIOS is unable to report all the media error records
it requires the OS to restart the scrub at a prescribed location. The
driver detects the overflow condition, but then fails to report it to
the ARS state machine after reaping the records. Propagate -ENOSPC
correctly to continue the ARS operation.
