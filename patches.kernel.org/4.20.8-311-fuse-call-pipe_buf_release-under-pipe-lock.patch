Subject: [PATCH] fuse: call pipe_buf_release() under pipe lock
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.8
Git-commit: 9509941e9c534920ccc4771ae70bd6cbbe79df1c

commit 9509941e9c534920ccc4771ae70bd6cbbe79df1c upstream.

Some of the pipe_buf_release() handlers seem to assume that the pipe is
locked - in particular, anon_pipe_buf_release() accesses pipe->tmp_page
without taking any extra locks. From a glance through the callers of
pipe_buf_release(), it looks like FUSE is the only one that calls
pipe_buf_release() without having the pipe locked.

This bug should only lead to a memory leak, nothing terrible.
