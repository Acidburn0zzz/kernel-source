Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: da850: fix interrupt numbers for clocksource
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.9
Git-commit: e3966a766865da7ced1dece663697861dd5cf103

commit e3966a766865da7ced1dece663697861dd5cf103 upstream.

The timer interrupts specified in commit 3652e2741f42 ("ARM: dts:
da850: Add clocks") are wrong but since the current timer code
hard-codes them, the bug was never spotted.

This patch must go into stable since, once we introduce a proper
clocksource driver, devices with buggy device tree will stop booting.
