Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: soc-core: fix init platform memory handling
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.20.13
Git-commit: 09ac6a817bd687e7f5dac00470262efdd72f9319

commit 09ac6a817bd687e7f5dac00470262efdd72f9319 upstream.

snd_soc_init_platform initializes pointers to snd_soc_dai_link which is
statically allocated and it does this by devm_kzalloc. In the event of
an EPROBE_DEFER the memory will be freed and the pointers are left
dangling. snd_soc_init_platform sees the dangling pointers and assumes
they are pointing to initialized memory and does not reallocate them on
the second probe attempt which results in a use after free bug since
devm has freed the memory from the first probe attempt.

Since the intention for snd_soc_dai_link->platform is that it can be set
statically by the machine driver we need to respect the pointer in the
event we did not set it but still catch dangling pointers. The solution
is to add a flag to track whether the pointer was dynamically allocated
or not.
