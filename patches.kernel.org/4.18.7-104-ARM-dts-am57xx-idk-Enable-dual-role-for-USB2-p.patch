Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: am57xx-idk: Enable dual role for USB2 port
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 4.18.7
Git-commit: 5f3cc16483d40bbc609a828511ff851296fc62b6

commit 5f3cc16483d40bbc609a828511ff851296fc62b6 upstream.

Dual-role support was added in v4.12. We should be using
it for USB2 port on the am57xx-idk.
