Subject: [PATCH] perf report: Add warning when libunwind not compiled in
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.4.7
Git-commit: 800d3f561659b5436f8c57e7c26dd1f6928b5615

[ Upstream commit 800d3f561659b5436f8c57e7c26dd1f6928b5615 ]

We received a user report that call-graph DWARF mode was enabled in
'perf record' but 'perf report' didn't unwind the callstack correctly.
The reason was, libunwind was not compiled in.

We can use 'perf -vv' to check the compiled libraries but it would be
valuable to report a warning to user directly (especially valuable for
a perf newbie).

The warning is:

Warning:
Please install libunwind development packages during the perf build.

Both TUI and stdio are supported.
