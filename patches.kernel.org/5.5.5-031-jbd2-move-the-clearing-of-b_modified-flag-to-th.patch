Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: move the clearing of b_modified flag to the
 journal_unmap_buffer()
References: bnc#1012628
Patch-mainline: 5.5.5
Git-commit: 6a66a7ded12baa6ebbb2e3e82f8cb91382814839

commit 6a66a7ded12baa6ebbb2e3e82f8cb91382814839 upstream.

There is no need to delay the clearing of b_modified flag to the
transaction committing time when unmapping the journalled buffer, so
just move it to the journal_unmap_buffer().
