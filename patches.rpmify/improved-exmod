Subject: [PATCH 2/2] kbuild: Improved external module support


[agruen] I also applied the following fix:

The Makefile is derived from the one you posted, I just typed it by hand.
Therefore the variable names differ.

In the "Match-Anything Rules::" part of 'info make' the trick needed to
let 'make drivers/char/mem.o' work was described - thanks for reminding me
of this issue.

The match-anything rule must be marked as terminal rule using double-colon -
viola.

#   kbuild: External module support improved
#   
#   To improve support for external modules and to make usage
#   of separate output directory easier the following
#   changes has been implemented:
#   
#   1) When using a separate output directory create a small
#      Makefile that is a simple wrapper, calling the Makefile
#      in the kernel tree.
#      - This allows the user to shift to the output directory
#        and execute make.
#      - The Makefile is also useful to document the location
#        source used for the kernel
#   
#   2) When installing the kernel a new symlink is now created
#      pointing to the source of kernel.
#   
#   3) The build symlink now points to the output of the kernel
#      compile.
#      - When a kernel is compiled with output and source
#        mixed, the build and source symlinks will point
#        to the same directory. In this case there is
#        no change in behaviour.
#   
#   Adding the Makefile in step 1) allow the for a long
#   time recommended way to build an external module to
#   continue working even with separate output directory.
#   
#   The following command now works independent of the kernel
#   being build with separate output directory, or with
#   output and source mixed.
#   
#           make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`
#   
#   [Substituting M= with SUBDIRS= give same effect].
#   
#   It is recommended that distributions pick up this
#   method, and especially start shipping kernel output and
#   source separately.
#   
#   Please note that when the kernel is being build
#   using a separate output directory it may (will?) break
#   modules that has not yet picked up the recommended
#   way to build modules for 2.6.
#   See Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt for details.
#   
#   Patch includes contributions from:
#           Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de> and
#           Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
