Subject: Don't use running kernel's config file by default

Users ran into the following problem: They grab a SuSE kernel-source
package that is more recent than their running kernel. The tree under
/usr/src/linux is unconfigured by default; there is no .config. User
does a ``make menuconfig'', which gets its default values from
/boot/config-$(uname -r). User tries to build the kernel, and the result
doesn't work.

I would like to get rid of using the running kernel's configuration
unless the user explicitly requests it. Instead, please add the
cloneconfig target to clone the running kernel's config file. See other
patch.
