Subject: powerpc: Build fix for mpc52xx
Patch-mainline: Submitted 10 Mar 2010

mpc52xx_gpt_wdt_setup is defined as 0, which causes the following build
failure with gcc 4.5, since it's built with -Werror.

arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/mpc52xx_gpt.c:761:3: error: statement with no effect

Defining it as do { } while(0) fixes the problem.
