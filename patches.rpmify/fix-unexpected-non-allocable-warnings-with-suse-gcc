Subject: kbuild, modpost: fix "unexpected non-allocatable" warning with SUSE gcc
Git-commit: 028ecebdd83cc4a7f8c7e96e28a5537d2ac98dae

Jean reported that he saw one warning for each module like the one below:
WARNING: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.o (.comment.SUSE.OPTs): unexpected non-allocatable section.

The warning appeared with the improved version of the
check of the flags in the sections.

That check already ignored sections named ".comment" - but SUSE store
additional info in the comment section and has named it in a SUSE
specific way. Therefore modpost failed to ignore the section.

The fix is to extend the pattern so we ignore all sections
that start with the name ".comment.".
