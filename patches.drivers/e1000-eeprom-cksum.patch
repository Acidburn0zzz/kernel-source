Subject: Fix bad eeprom checksum misdetection on some notebooks
Reference: 190417 235315
Mainline: never

This workaround fix a problem on some Lenovo notebooks where the first
call to e1000_validate_eeprom_checksum fails, because the PCIe was in a deep
powersave state. Better would be that Lenovo fix this via a BIOS update, but
maybe that will never happen...
