Subject: [ALSA] hda-codec - Fix orphan Headphone controls in STAC codecs
Patch-mainline: 
References: 

Currently, the headphone controls are created as Master wrongly in
some cases, and this prevents the virtual master controls.
The patch fixes the problem by simply using "Headphone" always for
headphone controls.
