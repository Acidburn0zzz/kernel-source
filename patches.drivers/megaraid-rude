Bugfix

In 2.4 the megaraid driver was careful to avoid stepping on wrong devices.
Specifically the megaraid3 series devices used an intel pci ID (8086:1960)
which is the generic i960 identifier not their own.

The code to do this in 2.4 worked for almost all cases, but even that
code has mysteriously vanished in 2.6 meaning the megaraid driver trashes
stuff like promise i2o cards and compaq management cards.

The following patch puts back the 2.4 stuff + one additional check so that
the driver isn't quite as rude as it was before.
