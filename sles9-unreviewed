#
# Unsorted list of SLES9 patches that may need review
#
# This patch does not include any patches that were
# obviously related to
#  -	lkcd, xfs, lustre, kdb, ckrm, ocfs, cpusets, PAGG
#	xen, UML, dmapi, dprobes, ltt, perfmon, jfs
#		For these, I expect our partners to provide
#		updated code drops
#  -	xen
#		I expect the Xen folks will now best what needs
#		forward porting
#  -	ppc, ia64, s390
#		I think this is the domain of the respective arch
#		maintainers anyway, who will have a much better idea
#		of what needs forward porting
#  -	LAuS (obsolete)
#  -	driver updates from partners which we received during SLES9
#	development (network, storage, ...).
#	fusion, ibmasm, qla2xxx, qla4xxx, cciss, aacraid, aic7xxx/79xx
