Subject: Replace indirect calls by a branch
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439

In the LSM stub collection, rather do a branch than an indirect
call. Many of the functions called do only return 0 or do nothing
for the default (capability) case.
This is a fast-path optimization; a branch is faster than an
indirect call, even more so if correctly predicted.
This shows a >3% perf. increase in netperf -t TCP_RR benchmark on IA64.
(More exactly: The benchmark was taken with the next two patches
 applied as well, but I attribute the main effect to this patch.)

This is patch 3/5 of the LSM overhaul.
