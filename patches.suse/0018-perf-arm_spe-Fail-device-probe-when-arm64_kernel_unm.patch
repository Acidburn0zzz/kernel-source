Subject: [PATCH 18/45] perf: arm_spe: Fail device probe when
 arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0()

Git-commit: 7a4a0c1555b824e0d3dd72942481b1190abea604
Patch-mainline: Queued
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
References: bsc#1068032

When running with the kernel unmapped whilst at EL0, the virtually-addressed
SPE buffer is also unmapped, which can lead to buffer faults if userspace
profiling is enabled and potentially also when writing back kernel samples
unless an expensive drain operation is performed on exception return.

For now, fail the SPE driver probe when arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0().
