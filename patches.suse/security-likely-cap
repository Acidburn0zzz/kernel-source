Subject: Consider the capability case the likely one
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439

The case that security_ops points to the default capability_
security_ops is the fast path and arguably the more likely one
on most systems. So mark it likely to tell the compiler to
optimize accordingly and increase the chances of having this
predicted correctly by the CPU.

This is patch 4/5 of the LSM overhaul.
