Subject: x86/head: Remove confusing comment
Patch-mainline: submitted on 9/19/2017
References: bnc#1058115

This comment is actively wrong and confusing.  It refers to the
registers' stack offsets after the pt_regs has been constructed on the
stack, but this code is *before* that.

At this point the stack just has the standard iret frame, for which no
comment should be needed.
