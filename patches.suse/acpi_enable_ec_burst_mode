Subject: enable ec burst by default

This patch enables EC burst mode by default (Could be disabled by ec_burst=0)
EC burst mode fixes some machines (#61106,#81520)
It is known to break others (I am only aware of ASUS L5D, battery problems)
It also makes ACPI_DEBUG usable again (no lost key strokes, sound problems)
(#102565)
This will probably be enabled by default in mainline again in near
future, we should already go for it now.
