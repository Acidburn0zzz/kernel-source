Subject: Tolerate PQ 3 at LUN 0 for scanning
Patch-mainline: 
References: 158532

Some devices report a peripheral qualifier of 3 for LUN 0; with the original
code, we would still try a REPORT_LUNS scan (if SCSI level is >= 3 or if we 
have the BLIST_REPORTLUNS2 passed in), but NOT any sequential scan.
Also, the device at LUN 0 (which is not connected according to the PQ) is not
registered with the OS.

Unfortunately, SANs exist that are SCSI-2 and do NOT support REPORT_LUNS, but
report a unknown device with PQ 3 on LUN 0. We still need to scan them, and
most probably we even need BLIST_SPARSELUN (and BLIST_LARGELUN). See the bug
reference for an infamous example.

This is patch 1/3:
If we end up in sequential scan, at least try LUN 1 for devices
that reported a PQ of 3 for LUN 0.
Also return blacklist flags, even for PQ3 devices.
