Subject: [PATCH] dm raid: fix stripe adding reshape deadlock
Git-commit: 644e2537fdc77baeeefc829524937bca64329f82
References: bsc#1111974
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc4

When initiating a stripe adding reshape, a deadlock between
md_stop_writes() waiting for the sync thread to stop and the running
sync thread waiting for inactive stripes occurs (this frequently happens
on single-core but rarely on multi-core systems).

Fix this deadlock by setting MD_RECOVERY_WAIT to have the main MD
resynchronization thread worker (md_do_sync()) bail out when initiating
the reshape via constructor arguments.
