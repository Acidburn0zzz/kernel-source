Subject: export audit logging symbols
Upstream: no

In SLE11 the following symbols were exported by patch 'apparmor-audit.diff'
With apparmor now being a built-in these exports were removed for SP1 but 
NSS requires that audit_log_untrustedstring be exported.

Re-export both symbols to be consistent with SLE11.
