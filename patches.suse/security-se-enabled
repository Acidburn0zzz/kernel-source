Subject: Test security_enabled var rather than security_ops pointer
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439

Rather than doing a pointer comparison, test an integer var
for being null. Should be slightly faster.
I consider this patch as optional.

Note that it does not introduce a (new) race, as we still set
the security_ops pointer to the capability_security_ops. So no
wmb() is needed for the module unload case.

Sidenote: A wmb() in the module load and unload cases might
actually be useful to ensure that the other CPUs start using the
new LSM pointer ASAP. It's still racy, but that's by design of
LSM. Introducing locks would hurt performance tremendously.
One could do RCU ... but that's not for this patchset.

This is patch 5/5 of the LSM overhaul.
