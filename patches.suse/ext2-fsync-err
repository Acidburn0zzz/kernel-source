Subject: ext2 should force the FS readonly for metadata write errors
References: 65718

During fsync we should check for write errors to the block device in order to make
sure all metadata writes have been properly written to the disk.  Without this check
writes that happen through the normal async mechanisms might hit errors without
reporting them back to the application.
