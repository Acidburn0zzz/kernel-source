Subject: [2.6 patch] add -Werror-implicit-function-declaration to CFLAGS
Patch-mainline: breaks akpm, but helps SuSE

Currently, using an undeclared function gives a compile warning, but it 
can lead to a link or even a runtime error.

With -Werror-implicit-function-declaration, we are getting an immediate 
compile error instead.

This patch also removes some unneeded spaces between two tabs in the 
following line.
