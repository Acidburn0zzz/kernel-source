From: Alon Bar-Lev <alon.barlev@gmail.com>

Current implementation allows the kernel to receive up to 255 characters from
the bootloader.  While the boot protocol allows greater buffers to be sent.

In current environment, the command-line is used in order to specify many
values, including suspend/resume, module arguments, splash, initramfs and
more.  

255 characters are not enough anymore. 

After edd issue was fixed, and dynammic kernel command-line patch was
accepted, we can extend the COMMAND_LINE_SIZE without runtime memory
requirements.
