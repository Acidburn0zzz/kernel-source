Subject: Documentation: e1000: Fix docs build error
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git
Git-commit: 805f16a5f12fd68e10841013ccfaceb2f4d7066a
References: none

Recent patch updated e1000 docs to rst format.  Docs build (`make
htmldocs`) is currently failing due to this file with error:

        (SEVERE/4) Unexpected section title.

This is because a section of the file is indented 2 spaces.  Build error
can be cleared by aligning the text with column 0.  While we are changing
these lines we can make sure line length does not exceed 72, that
newlines following headings are uniform, and that full stops are
followed by two spaces.

Align text with column 0, limit line length to 72, ensure two spaces
follow all full stops, ensure uniform use of newlines after heading.

Fixes commit (228046e76189 Documentation: e1000: Update kernel documentation)

-  Notes:
-  Degradation in throughput performance may be observed in some Jumbo frames
-  environments. If this is observed, increasing the application's socket buffer
-  size and/or increasing the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*mem entry values may help.
-  See the specific application manual and /usr/src/linux*/Documentation/
