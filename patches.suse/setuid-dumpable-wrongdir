Subject: suid-dumpable ended up in wrong sysctl dir
Patch-mainline: never

Diffing in sysctl.c is tricky, using more context is recommended.
suid_dumpable ended up in fs/ instead of kernel/ and the reason
is likely a patch with too little context.

NOTE: This has been in the wrong dir fs/ since it was introduced by
Alan Cox into mainline on 2005-06-23. However, SUSE shipped it
in the correct directory kernel/ in SLES9.

By now, it's just something that we are going to have to drag along for
a long time until SLES 11/12/13 time frame...
