Hello

I run in this problem too on my alpha sx164 and the patch fix this, so
i can load all the modules without problems.

Please add the patch to the kernel 2.6.x alpha mainline.

Regards
Tom

This failure happens with GPRELHIGH relocation, which is *signed*
short, but relocation overflow check in module.c doesn't take into
account the sign extension.
Appended patch should help.
