Subject: x86, uv: add early detection of UV system types
References: bnc#429984
Patch-Mainline: yes

I missed one line of the UV infrastructure patch.

The code is already upstream as part of a larger UV patch
but was somehow lost from the final UV infrastructure patch that was
sent to SuSE.

This change is necessary to detect that the system is a UV system prior
to parsing the SRAT processor information.
