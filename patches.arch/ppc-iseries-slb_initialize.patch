Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: iSeries needs slb_initialize to be called
X-Git-Commit: 856d08ec46c5ecf3df13827c492fb6998fdc8322                                                                                                               
Patch-mainline: 2.6.17-rc1

Bug 154542 - LTC22125-Beta 6 ISERIES64 requires multiple cpu's to boot

Since the powerpc 64k pages patch went in, systems that have SLBs
(like Power4 iSeries) needed to have slb_initialize called to set up
some variables for the SLB miss handler.  This was not being called
on the boot processor on iSeries, so on single cpu iSeries machines,
we would get apparent memory curruption as soon as we entered user mode.

This patch fixes that by calling slb_initialize on the boot cpu if the
processor has an SLB.
